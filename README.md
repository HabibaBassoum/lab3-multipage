Project Description
This project is a multipage responsive website that uses HTML5 and CSS3. The pages that are involved are home page which used flexbox to display sections side by side, includes a hero banner with background image and welcome text, and features a navigation bar. Then we have the services page that uses CSS grig to arrange services cards in a structured way, with each service card there is padding, borders, and hover effects. Lastly, a contact page that includes an HTML5 form, form fields are arranged responsively and button hover and input focus effects. 
For styling and techniques we used, flexbox that was used for the navigation bar and homepage layout. CSS grid used for implementing the layout for the service cards. Media queries for breakpoints for 1024px, etc. Animations for smooth hover effects and keyframe transitions.For responsive images, we ensured images scale correctly using max-width: 100%
